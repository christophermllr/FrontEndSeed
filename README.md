This project serves as a basic project structure for your front end code and build based on angular, less, typescript, jade, gulp, and bower.


Overview
============

This project serves as a basic structure for your front end code and build.   The key features of the build process include:

* Live preview and re-load system that allows you to edit, save, and automatically preview your files in the browser
* LESS stylesheet compilation
* Jade template compilation for HTML code
* A JSON proxy that allows you to hit a REST API without configuring CORS
* Automated unit testing with Karma, Jasmine, and phantomjs

# Quick start

Assuming you've got the appropriate prerequisites installed you simply need to fire up a command window, install npm dependencies, bower dependencies, and then run gulp

From the ``Web`` folder execute:

```
	npm install
	bower install
	gulp
```

This should build the project and stqart up the live reload server  

# Using the build system

Once you've installed all of the NPM and Bower dependencies, you can simply run `gulp` command line.   This compiles and runs the default LiveReload server and system.  

## Prerequisites

In order for front-end dev you should install the following items:

* Node - [http://nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org)
* Gulp js plugin - See below
* Typescript
* Bower
* LESS
* Karma

### Installing gulp
The build leverages [gulpjs](http://www.gulpjs.com) for automating the build project.   Gulp is delivered a s a node js module
. In order to install the packages, run the following command in the command prompt after node is installed

```
npm install -g gulp
```

### Gulp Configuration
The build leverages a config file located at ``Web\gulp\config\frontEndBuild.json``.  This file sets up the key paths and variables needed to control the build.

### Key gulp tasks

There are several useful tasks  in gulp to get you going, ultimately you can run ``gulp`` and the default task will create a livereload server on port 3000

Other tasks of interest include ``gulp build`` which runs a dist build and places it under the *build\dist* folder, or ``gulp build-dev`` which creates a dev build and places it under the *build\dev* folder
